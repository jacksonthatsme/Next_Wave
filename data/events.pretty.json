A gigantic, rotating four-room box is the dizzying place where these loose-limbed actors, dancers, and acrobats dodge falling furniture and tumble their way to acrobatic virtuosity, always with impeccable timing. Conceived by choreographer Martin Zimmermann and composer Dimitri de Perrot, who performs his ecstatic original score, Hans was Heiri offers a hilarious portrait of human relationships conveyed through a witty scenic language all its own."

In Nosferatu, Poland’s TR Warszawa and Teatr Narodowy dig beneath that veneer to deliver a deeply hypnotic, visually sumptuous new take on the vampire legend. Set to an unnerving score by downtown fixture John Zorn, director Grzegorz Jarzyna’s production suspends us in a liquid-green world of shadowy set pieces, brimming with eroticism, while returning to the legend’s deep reflections on fear and the human need for transgression."

Studded with contemporary references (renditions of songs by David Bowie and Gnarls Barkley, an excerpt of the incendiary 2008 political manifesto The Coming Insurrection), Ostermeier’s production brings Ibsen’s dark satire to a boil—and, with help from the people, a solitary whistleblower to his knees."

A boldly original concept that started as an installation piece at the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam and evolved into a full-fledged theatrical account of the universe’s creation, The Humans comes to BAM in its culminating chapter: a deliciously indecent mixed-media account of Man’s fall from grace. <br> Modeled on the comic writings of Aristophanes and set at the dawn of time and space, The Humans tells the tale of two spirits named Tophole and Pantalingua, who would rather the Earth not be created at all. In a battle against the egomaniacal Creator, they conspire their way to an accidental Paradise Lost, ultimately corrupting the eponymous humans—portrayed as a songful and statuesque Greek chorus—into the flawed mortals we are today."

In this ravishing retelling of Beauty and the Beast, acclaimed creators Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon transform a classic fairy tale into a grand feat of technological daring, charting breathtaking new territory in live performance.<br>Actors interact seamlessly with sophisticated projected imagery as a mercurial dream world unfolds. A ghostlike horse charges through a tangled forest of thorns, a mirror breaks in an explosion of virtual glass, and a phantom moves in for his disembodied kiss, hypnotizing us with this story about the redemptive power of love."

It is a sequel of sorts to Bocanegra’s work When a Priest Marries a Witch, which used a similar approach to explore her Texas upbringing and had its premiere in 2010 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Upon viewing that earlier work, Academy Award-winning actor Frances McDormand suggested an artistic collaboration to Bocanegra. Exploring topics as disparate as Roman art, Rose queens, and Texas drill teams, Bodycast mines specific details of Bocanegra’s life to create a more general meditation on art-making and shifting ideals of feminine beauty. Singer Theo Bleckmann and dancer Emily Coates will make guest appearances in the work."

Like an actor possessed, the fiery Shaw inhabits the very marrow of this epic 18th-century poem, bounding across the stage while transforming Coleridge’s luminous language into an exhilarating lived experience.<br>In the icy Antarctic, a ship is lost at sea. And when a mariner shoots a bird thought to be the crew’s salvation, his macabre, guilt-inducing fate—the veritable “albatross around the neck”—is decided. Accompanied by dancer Daniel Hay Gordon, who offers interpretive counterpoint throughout, Shaw skirts a whirlpool, braves a crew of corpses, and rolls Death’s dice with poetic abandon, taking us to hell and back."

A follow-up to his 1985 epic The Dragons’ Trilogy, The Blue Dragon revisits Pierre (played by Lepage), an expat art curator and former painter navigating a love triangle and a midlife crisis. A tiered set, inspired by the vivid colors and composition of graphic novels, shifts ingeniously from dank apartment to karaoke bar to billboard-strewn cityscape, as a bittersweet vision of a country seduced by modernity unfolds."

Behind a blur of color—created by hundreds of cloth strands stretched across the stage—dancers ricochet off one another in a strobe-like flurry of actions: captured, suspended, and broken apart. Microphones installed throughout the space pick up every sound, amplifying the laws of gravity and inertia, as the dancers transgress space and time."

Six dancers inhabit a blissfully nonsensical world in which the floor and ceiling are occasionally reversed, the non sequitur is king, and movement perpetually affirms the now"

Brilliantly attuned to each individual dancer’s quirks and complex identities, Weare orchestrates a series of duets, solos, and trios that explore exposure, self-censorship, and vulnerability, examining how—in the safest, most indeterminate spaces—bodies offer up secrets of their inner life."

For this work, Preljocaj offers an epic encounter with the end of the world, exploring the apocalypse as a revelation of the deepest truths of our being.Electronic music by influential DJ Laurent Garnier, mixed with samples of Beethoven, and a dramatic staging by renowned artist Subodh Gupta set the mood. Alternating between intense, slashing gestures and classical ballet, the 21 dancers of Ballet Preljocaj evoke the visions of life and death, calm and chaos, that have long kept us clamoring for redemption."

A commissioned score by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang—performed live by members of guitar quartet Dither and Mantra Percussion—animates this dialogue between the real and the virtual, in which bodies hover somewhere in between."

Inspired by Zora Neale Hurston’s vernacular retelling in Moses, Man of the Mountain, Wilson traveled to Israel, Egypt, Turkey, and Mali to consider the migration of African people throughout the world. The result is this rich evening-length work—choreographed for nine performers and set to live vocalizations from the African diaspora and beyond—that unflinchingly questions leadership and our complex relationship to the Moses story."

With each piece lending its own unique dancers, ideas, and approaches, Bleed forms a serendipitous new choreographic language. Meanings multiply through the layering, blending, and erasure of elements from each work, and in the choreographic threshold between process and product, craft and coincidence, a poetic logic is revealed."

In A Rite, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company and Anne Bogart’s SITI Company—two ensembles with rich histories at BAM—join minds, bodies, and voices to offer this dance-theater celebration of Stravinsky’s incendiary work and its tremendous cultural resonance.<br>With clutched thighs and fists beating the ground, barefoot performers channel Vaslav Nijinsky’s original 1913 choreography to the crackle of a vintage recording. A shell-shocked WWI vet hears bombs in the opening chords, while an impassioned scholar waxes poetic about the radical structure of Stravinsky’s work. As the maelstrom morphs into chorales sung by the actors and dancers, who are virtually indistinguishable from one another, we tread the raw nerves of a masterpiece, which touches ours in return."

Wielding giant sheets of cardboard, the dancers conjure an array of kinetic imagery and sounds—deepening this beguiling translation and evoking a world in which one language is withheld while another rises to the surface."

His muse is the late Benjamin Smoke—eccentric front man of the 90s underground band Smoke, queer activist, occasional drag queen, and the subject of Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen’s acclaimed 2000 documentary—whose raw rock music touched on every facet of resiliency and loss.<br>Amid a junk-strewn set—designed by Brooklyn-based sculptor Jonah Emerson-Bell (in collaboration with street artist Caledonia “Swoon” Curry), Come, and Back Again features projections by video artist Shawn Hove and arrangements of Smoke’s music performed live by a band led by Brooklyn-based musician Sam Crawford. Dorfman’s athletic, heroic dancers abandon themselves to the mire, exploring how time, humility, hope, and love help us manage our teetering existence."

Soon, hands replace knives—fingers drum, palms swish, fists pound, nails scratch—and a rhythm starts to percolate.<br>The sounds are breathtaking, and just a hint at what’s to come in this work by the imaginative Polish music ensemble Karbido, in which an ordinary piece of furniture becomes an unlikely instrument with infinite sonic possibilities. With bowed strings mounted and amplifiers installed within, the table—created by the musicians themselves, with the technical wizardry of carpenters and sound engineers—comes thrillingly to life. Voices join the fold, a didgeridoo mumbles, bells ting, and amid ghostly shivers of sound, a table is transfigured."

Whatever the style, the sound of Gary Lucas—described by The New York Times as a “songwriter with a global guitar”—is unmistakable. Founder of the rock band Gods and Monsters and a former collaborator with Jeff Buckley (Lucas co-wrote the song “Grace”) and Captain Beefheart, among countless others, Lucas continues to provoke and refashion American music while finding its echo in unlikely places.<br>In The Edge of Heaven, that place is shidaiqu, the alluring jazz-tinged popular music that flourished in 1930s and 40s China (and was used evocatively by Wong Kar-Wai in his 2000 film In the Mood for Love). Accompanied by Shanghai-based vocalists Sally Kwok and Mo Hai Jing, Lucas and his band pay tribute to two icons of this style, Chow Hsuan and Bai Kwong. Wistful projections of street scenes of old Shanghai transport us in this evening of lilting romantic melodies filtered through the sonic vistas of American experience."

To embrace all cultures with compassion? To take enormous risks—and persevere?<br>In this deeply personal evening of music and dance, composer Fred Ho’s Green Monster Big Band channels the spirit of Muhammad Ali and other fighter figures who knew how to take punches while standing their ground. Performing choreography by Emmanuel Brown (a lead in Broadway’s Spiderman), dancers Marquez Vargas, Daniel Napolitano, Mathieu Williams, and Brown himself invoke everything from lightning-quick martial arts to the bounce and sting of Ali’s dazzling footwork. Marie Incontrera conducts Ho’s exuberant jazz score as it delivers a swaggering, brassy testament to the champion’s strut, color-blind vision, and humanity."
