  quote: ...part-acrobatics, part-dance and part-slapstick show with a freewheeling feel...
  reviewer: London Evening Standard
  description: In this trailblazing work directed by the inventive Swiss duo Zimmermann & de Perrot, seven performers inhabit a topsy-turvy world where, at any moment, the ceiling can become a floor, a floor can become a wall, and a door can become a chasm. A gigantic, rotating four-room box is the dizzying place where these loose-limbed actors, dancers, and acrobats dodge falling furniture and tumble their way to acrobatic virtuosity, always with impeccable timing. Conceived by choreographer Martin Zimmermann and composer Dimitri de Perrot, who performs his ecstatic original score, Hans was Heiri offers a hilarious portrait of human relationships conveyed through a witty scenic language all its own.

  quote: A vampiric symphony of terror… to the beat of music composed by John Zorn, guru of the New York avant-garde.
  reviewer: Rzeczpospolita (Poland)
  description: Terrifying, yet seductive. Blood-thirsty harbingers of death who extend a twisted promise of immortality. The vampire figure has long been defined by Bram Stoker’s classic interpretation, Dracula. In Nosferatu, Poland’s TR Warszawa and Teatr Narodowy dig beneath that veneer to deliver a deeply hypnotic, visually sumptuous new take on the vampire legend. Set to an unnerving score by downtown fixture John Zorn, director Grzegorz Jarzyna’s production suspends us in a liquid-green world of shadowy set pieces, brimming with eroticism, while returning to the legend’s deep reflections on fear and the human need for transgression.

  description: Theater, music, sculpture, Nesquik bunnies, Greco-Roman masks, and a gigantic mountain find common cause in this irreverent performance work by the award-winning British visual artist Alexandre Singh. A boldly original concept that started as an installation piece at the Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam and evolved into a full-fledged theatrical account of the universeуs creation, The Humans comes to BAM in its culminating chapter; a deliciously indecent mixed-media account of Manуs fall from grace. <br> Modeled on the comic writings of Aristophanes and set at the dawn of time and space, The Humans tells the tale of two spirits named Tophole and Pantalingua, who would rather the Earth not be created at all. In a battle against the egomaniacal Creator, they conspire their way to an accidental Paradise Lost, ultimately corrupting the eponymous humansяportrayed as a songful and statuesque Greek chorusяinto the flawed mortals we are today.

  reviewer: The Independent (UK)
  description: In a beautiful theatrical reverie, director David Farr joins forces with Filter Theatre to present an exquisitely crafted story that reveals how the cracks in our most intimate human relationships resonate on a global scale.<br>Set beneath a vertical lake of light, ebbing from lavender to cerulean blue, Water intertwines two deeply personal dramas, both cast in the shadow of the struggle against climate change. Buoyed by live music and real-time video, this deft, dreamlike rendering of the personal and political asks how we can reach beyond ourselves and bond, like water, with those around us.

  reviewer: The Boston Globe
  description: A disfigured recluse hides his pain in a lonely mansion, until a beautiful artist appears, nursing her own heartache. In this ravishing retelling of Beauty and the Beast, acclaimed creators Michel Lemieux and Victor Pilon transform a classic fairy tale into a grand feat of technological daring, charting breathtaking new territory in live performance.<br>Actors interact seamlessly with sophisticated projected imagery as a mercurial dream world unfolds. A ghostlike horse charges through a tangled forest of thorns, a mirror breaks in an explosion of virtual glass, and a phantom moves in for his disembodied kiss, hypnotizing us with this story about the redemptive power of love.

  description: Inspired by the two teenage years visual artist Suzanne Bocanegra spent in a body cast due to scoliosis, Bodycast is an inventive theatricalization of the ubiquitous рartist talk.с Part performance and part essay, Bocanegra uses the format to explore how and why she became an artist. It is a sequel of sorts to Bocanegraуs work When a Priest Marries a Witch, which used a similar approach to explore her Texas upbringing and had its premiere in 2010 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Upon viewing that earlier work, Academy Award-winning actor Frances McDormand suggested an artistic collaboration to Bocanegra. Exploring topics as disparate as Roman art, Rose queens, and Texas drill teams, Bodycast mines specific details of Bocanegraуs life to create a more general meditation on art-making and shifting ideals of feminine beauty. Singer Theo Bleckmann and dancer Emily Coates will make guest appearances in the work.

  reviewer: Financial Times on Fiona Shaw
  description: Water, water everywhere.с Fiona Shaw delivers a masterful performance of Samuel Taylor Coleridgeуs eerie tale of penance paid on the high seas. Like an actor possessed, the fiery Shaw inhabits the very marrow of this epic 18th-century poem, bounding across the stage while transforming Coleridgeуs luminous language into an exhilarating lived experience.<br>In the icy Antarctic, a ship is lost at sea. And when a mariner shoots a bird thought to be the crewуs salvation, his macabre, guilt-inducing fateяthe veritable рalbatross around the neckсяis decided. Accompanied by dancer Daniel Hay Gordon, who offers interpretive counterpoint throughout, Shaw skirts a whirlpool, braves a crew of corpses, and rolls Deathуs dice with poetic abandon, taking us to hell and back.

In Not What Happened, Obie Award-winning writer-director Ain Gordon, photographer Forrest Holzapfel, and director Ken Rus Schmoll take that question to the overlooked farms and fallow fields of Americaуs rural past.<br>Two seemingly identical women appear on stage; one is a historical reenactor nearing the end of her career, theatrically channeling a bygone 1804; the other is her doppelganger, the 19th-century subject she рrecreates. Amid projected images of cast-off farm tools and other ruins of rural life, we follow the reenactorуs crafted narrative alongside that of her ghostly double. History lived vies with history told, leaving us to wonder- can we ever know what really happened?

A follow-up to his 1985 epic The Dragonsу Trilogy, The Blue Dragon revisits Pierre (played by Lepage), an expat art curator and former painter navigating a love triangle and a midlife crisis. A tiered set, inspired by the vivid colors and composition of graphic novels, shifts ingeniously from dank apartment to karaoke bar to billboard-strewn cityscape, as a bittersweet vision of a country seduced by modernity unfolds.

  quote: Brooks loves to shatter conventional notions of the human capacity for strength and endurance.
  reviewer: Dance Magazine
  description: "Brian Brooks is a daring choreographer, concocting precise, kinetic, and volatile sequences of movement that test the threshold of physical endurance. In Run Donуt Run, Brooks (recently awarded a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship) employs rapid-fire partnering to explore the spatial contradictions of bodies in motion. Behind a blur of colorяcreated by hundreds of cloth strands stretched across the stageяdancers ricochet off one another in a strobe-like flurry of actions: captured, suspended, and broken apart. Microphones installed throughout the space pick up every sound, amplifying the laws of gravity and inertia, as the dancers transgress space and time."

  quote: ...a strong choreographic personality a refreshing mixture of casualness and discipline, lunacy and sincerity...
  reviewer: The New Yorker
  description: As a dancer with Mark Morris Dance Group, John Heginbotham won over audiences with his magnetism and incisive musicality. With Dance Heginbotham, he combines clever movement with a range of music, from Daft Punk to Irving Berlin, into an utterly compelling form of dance-theater.<br>For their BAM debut, Heginbotham and company present Dark Theater, a brand new work inspired by Dadaist painter Francis Picabiaуs provocative 1924 ballet Rel┴che, set to a mellifluous score by Erik Satie. Six dancers inhabit a blissfully nonsensical world in which the floor and ceiling are occasionally reversed, the non sequitur is king, and movement perpetually affirms the now

  quote: No one else is making work quite like hers.
  reviewer: The Village Voice
  description: In this provocative new work, Kate Weareяthe BAM Fisherуs first artist-in-residenceяlooks to sexual fantasy as a metaphor for creative expression, using the stage as a place where we can perform as the most potent, desiring versions of ourselves.<br>An original cello score by Chris Lancaster ushers us into this suggestive realm, fetishized and electrified by Weareуs sensual, aggressively intertwined movement vocabulary. Brilliantly attuned to each individual dancerуs quirks and complex identities, Weare orchestrates a series of duets, solos, and trios that explore exposure, self-censorship, and vulnerability, examining howяin the safest, most indeterminate spacesяbodies offer up secrets of their inner life.

  quote: Preljocaj is a clever choreographer, superb at eliciting a raw, uninhibited physicality
  reviewer: The Guardian (UK)
  description: Sensual, dramatic, and daring is the world of choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, a sought-after master provocateur whose works have ranged from an erotic Snow White, featuring costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier, to a commission for New York City Ballet set to music by John Cage. For this work, Preljocaj offers an epic encounter with the end of the world, exploring the apocalypse as a revelation of the deepest truths of our being.Electronic music by influential DJ Laurent Garnier, mixed with samples of Beethoven, and a dramatic staging by renowned artist Subodh Gupta set the mood. Alternating between intense, slashing gestures and classical ballet, the 21 dancers of Ballet Preljocaj evoke the visions of life and death, calm and chaos, that have long kept us clamoring for redemption.

  reviewer: The Guardian (UK)
  description: Israeli-born, UK-based choreographer Hofesh Shechterуs highly visceral, theatrical dance pieces pair explosive, almost primal movement with the exhilarating sounds and smoky atmosphere of a rock concert. A former dancer with Ohad Naharinуs Batsheva Dance Company, Shechter and his company have performed sold-out shows at Sadlerуs Wells in London and to packed houses in Paris, Sydney, and Tokyo.<br>This season, he returns to BAM with Sun, a brand-new work featuring an expanded company of 14 dancers and an eclectic soundtrack that includes original music by Shechter himself.

  description: In an electric guitar-fueled evening of postmodern dance-theater, Susan Marshall couples her intimate, structured choreography with the seductiveness of pop culture to explore our complex relationship to the media we consume.<br>Referencing the dance moves and sleek production values of popular music videos, Marshallуs choreography adds nuance to that high-gloss aesthetic while stripping away its context, rendering it both more profound and strange. A commissioned score by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Langяperformed live by members of guitar quartet Dither and Mantra Percussionяanimates this dialogue between the real and the virtual, in which bodies hover somewhere in between.

  quote: ...one of this country’s most talented choreographers...
  reviewer: The New York Times
  description: "A master choreographer and interpreter of movement traditions from the African diaspora, Reggie Wilson refracts elements of blues, slave, and spiritual cultures through postmodern structures to create his “post-African/neo-HooDoo” style.<br>In Moses(es), he examines the many representations of Moses in religious texts—and in the mythical, canonical, and ethnographic imaginations—to ask: how do we lead and why do we follow? Inspired by Zora Neale Hurston’s vernacular retelling in Moses, Man of the Mountain, Wilson traveled to Israel, Egypt, Turkey, and Mali to consider the migration of African people throughout the world. The result is this rich evening-length work—choreographed for nine performers and set to live vocalizations from the African diaspora and beyond—that unflinchingly questions leadership and our complex relationship to the Moses story."

  description: "Marking the culmination of a two-year endeavor, choreographer Tere O’Connor collapses three of his dance works—Secret Mary, based on themes of authorship and agency; poem, a study in formalism, artifice, and complexity; and Untitled, a duet about the minutiae of personality—into a single hybrid creation. With each piece lending its own unique dancers, ideas, and approaches, Bleed forms a serendipitous new choreographic language. Meanings multiply through the layering, blending, and erasure of elements from each work, and in the choreographic threshold between process and product, craft and coincidence, a poetic logic is revealed."

  description: "Since its riot-inciting Parisian premiere a century ago, The Rite of Spring has taken on near-mythic status as a symbol of artistic insurrection and a cornerstone of the avant-garde. In A Rite, Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company and Anne Bogart’s SITI Company—two ensembles with rich histories at BAM—join minds, bodies, and voices to offer this dance-theater celebration of Stravinsky’s incendiary work and its tremendous cultural resonance.<br>With clutched thighs and fists beating the ground, barefoot performers channel Vaslav Nijinsky’s original 1913 choreography to the crackle of a vintage recording. A shell-shocked WWI vet hears bombs in the opening chords, while an impassioned scholar waxes poetic about the radical structure of Stravinsky’s work. As the maelstrom morphs into chorales sung by the actors and dancers, who are virtually indistinguishable from one another, we tread the raw nerves of a masterpiece, which touches ours in return."

  quote: Brilliant, inscrutable and wildly entertaining...
  reviewer: The Guardian (UK) on William Forsythe
  description: "For choreographer William Forsythe, the stage is a large-scale laboratory for boundless theatrical and linguistic investigation. In Sider, the knotty speech rhythms of late-16th-century Elizabethan tragedy form the unlikely point of departure.<br>Dancers, equipped with earphones that play a recording unheard by the audience, deliver fragmented, enigmatic movements based on the cadences and meanings of the sumptuous Elizabethan text. Wielding giant sheets of cardboard, the dancers conjure an array of kinetic imagery and sounds—deepening this beguiling translation and evoking a world in which one language is withheld while another rises to the surface."

Soon, hands replace knives—fingers drum, palms swish, fists pound, nails scratch—and a rhythm starts to percolate.<br>The sounds are breathtaking, and just a hint at what’s to come in this work by the imaginative Polish music ensemble Karbido, in which an ordinary piece of furniture becomes an unlikely instrument with infinite sonic possibilities. With bowed strings mounted and amplifiers installed within, the table—created by the musicians themselves, with the technical wizardry of carpenters and sound engineers—comes thrillingly to life. Voices join the fold, a didgeridoo mumbles, bells ting, and amid ghostly shivers of sound, a table is transfigured."

  quote: Cohen’s freeform assemblages triumphantly assert a unique mode of viewing the world…with a hypnotic poetry of the everyday...
  reviewer: Time Out London
  description: "DIY auteur and consummate independent filmmaker Jem Cohen (Museum Hours, Instrument, Benjamin Smoke) collaborates with a supergroup of acclaimed musicians— Guy Picciotto (Fugazi), Jim White (Dirty Three), T. Griffin (The Quavers), Efrim Manuel Menuck and Sophie Trudeau (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Thee Silver Mt. Zion), and Jessica Moss (Thee Silver Mt. Zion), plus guest vocalist Mira Billotte (White Magic)—in this cinematic love letter to Nova Scotia’s Cape Breton.<br>Multiple layered film projections are interspersed with texts, ranging from poems to local folklore, and buoyed by the group’s alternately ethereal and epic original score. Shot over the course of a decade, We Have An Anchor—which was originally commissioned by the Experimental Media & Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) in Troy, NY, and premiered there last year—is an elegiac record of a place suspended in time, attuned to the icy fields, wind-whipped grasses, and lulling surf that mark this extraordinary landscape."

  quote: An activist as well as a musician, Ho’s arrangements are as outstanding and unique as Ali’s boxing style.
  reviewer: Jazz Word
  description: "What could an 18-piece big band learn from the guy who knocked out George Foreman in the eighth round? To wield incredible power yet remain light on its feet? To embrace all cultures with compassion? To take enormous risks—and persevere?<br>In this deeply personal evening of music and dance, composer Fred Ho’s Green Monster Big Band channels the spirit of Muhammad Ali and other fighter figures who knew how to take punches while standing their ground. Performing choreography by Emmanuel Brown (a lead in Broadway’s Spiderman), dancers Marquez Vargas, Daniel Napolitano, Mathieu Williams, and Brown himself invoke everything from lightning-quick martial arts to the bounce and sting of Ali’s dazzling footwork. Marie Incontrera conducts Ho’s exuberant jazz score as it delivers a swaggering, brassy testament to the champion’s strut, color-blind vision, and humanity."

  description: "An early bird pulls on a string (mistaken for a worm), which shoots a pistol, which bursts a bag, which drips water on a man, who gradually wakes up…<br>The absurdist inventions of Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Rube Goldberg (1883—1970)—which include such contraptions as the Simple Alarm Clock, the Modest Mosquito Bite Scratcher, and a ridiculously complex method for lighting a cigar in a speeding car—come to life in composer, musician, and filmmaker Andy Biskin’s Goldberg’s Variations.<br>In a series of droll black-and-white animations based on Goldberg’s original illustrated designs, Biskin sets apparatus after apparatus in motion to the sounds of his whimsical original score. Performed by an all-star sextet featuring Biskin on clarinet, the music channels early jazz, vaudeville, and Looney Tunes-style mayhem to add tongue-in-cheek drama to these masterstrokes of ingenuity and wit."

  quote: Painfully beautiful.
  reviewer: Politiken (Denmark)
  description: "In this beautiful, audacious merging of Japanese manga imagery, texts from traditional Noh theater, electronic sounds, and new music sung by the Latvian Radio Choir, War Sum Up ponders the essence of war.<br>Twelve bodies, shadow-dappled and anonymous, stand on a looming stage. They inhabit a scarred two-dimensional world, trapped behind projections of images of combat: an explosion, a suit of armor, a hand turning into a gun. Amid this stylized tableau are lush, dissonant chorales by Latvian composer Santa Ratniece, alternating with crackling soundscapes by British electronic pop group the Irrepressibles, intoning hymns to the warrior, spy, and soldier."
